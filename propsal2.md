AI CLIENT ONBOARDING AUTOMATION (MVP) 
Client: Jeffersonflashy 
Prepared by: Waleed Asif 
Platform: Lovable 
Project Duration: 18 Days 
Total Budget: $250 
Milestones: 1 (Single Delivery) 
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project involves the development of an AI-powered client onboarding automation 
platform, built directly on the Lovable platform, with Stripe-based subscription 
payments and secure data storage using Supabase. 
The platform is designed for brokers (real estate agents, insurance agents, mortgage 
brokers) who are the paying subscribers of the system. 
The client (Jeffersonflashy) acts as the platform owner and administrator. 
The system automates onboarding for brokers’ clients by collecting data, documents, and 
optional identity verification through secure AI-driven workflows, controlled by a token
based usage model.
