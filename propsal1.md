AI CLIENT ONBOARDING AUTOMATION (MVP) 
Client: Jeffersonflashy 
Prepared by: Waleed Asif 
Platform: Lovable 
Project Duration: 18 Days 
Total Budget: $250 
Milestones: 1 (Single Delivery) 
PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project involves the development of an AI-powered client onboarding and lead
generation platform built on the Lovable platform, with Stripe-based subscriptions and 
secure data storage using Supabase. 
The platform is designed for brokers (real estate agents, insurance agents, mortgage 
brokers), who are the paying subscribers. Brokers independently choose, customize, and 
send onboarding forms to their clients. 
The platform owner (Jeffersonflashy) acts as the administrator but does not control when 
or how forms are used.
